## Who I am?
- 👋 Hi, I’m [ @elliotfern](https://github.com/elliotfern/) (Elliot Fernandez). I was born in Barcelona (Spain) in 1987. I'm a BA in Modern History at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona in 2009 and MA in World History at Pompeu Fabra University finished in 2011 with Master's thesis about Modern French History. Between 2017 and 2022 I worked as a Front-end developer and co-founder of Hispano Atlantic Consulting Ltd, HispanTIC. Now I'm a full-stack developer freelance.

## What I do and what I am learning?
- 🌱 As a full-stack developer, I'm currently work with PHP programming language, HTML, CSS (Boostrap v5) and JavaScript. 
- In September 2023 I finished a Bootcamp where I learned JavaScript libraries like React and others technologies as Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. I'm also learning React Native and PHP frameworks like Laravel.
